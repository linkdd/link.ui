Python/Web framework to build complex data processing and visualization systems.

## Notes

Versionning is based on an alpha-numeric code respecting the following rules :

```
<release code><release number><version code><version number>
```

With :

 * ``release code`` as ``R``
 * ``version code`` as :
   * ``A`` for ``Alpha``
   * ``B`` for ``Beta``
   * ``C`` for ``Candidate``
   * ``F`` for ``Final``

Example:

```
R1A3
R2B1
R3C8
R4F1
```
